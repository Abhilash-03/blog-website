            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.
                In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females.
                National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017-18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for
                female.[5] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were
                18%, 27% and 9%.[6] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to
                its economic development.dividend from India's comparatively young population.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS) is a program that
                pairs high schools with software engineers who serve as part-time computer science teachers.
                
                The program was started in 2009 by Microsoft software engineer Kevin Wang, but after Wang's divisional
                president learned about the program, Microsoft incubated the program. TEALS' goal is to create
                self-perpetuating computer science programs within two or three years by having the software engineers
                teach the teachers. Volunteers undergo a three-month summer class that teach them about making lesson
                plans and leading classes. Afterwards, software engineers visit classrooms four or five mornings a week
                for the entire school year to teach computer science concepts to both students and teachers.
                
                TEALS volunteers are not required to be Microsoft employees and can have formal degrees or be
                self-taught in computer science. TEALS offers support for three classes: Introduction to Computer
                Science, Web Design, and AP Computer Science A.</p>

                could plausibly change. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding
                of past and present, and to explore the possibility of future events and trends.[4]
